### Upgrade Notes - Requires 1.6.7-tectonic.2

To upgrade to Tectonic 1.7.1-tectonic.1, you must first update to `1.6.7-tectonic.2`. Once running `1.6.7-tectonic.2`, change the update channel to `1.7-preproduction` or `1.7-production` and click "Check for update". Update packages will be released to these channels in a rolling fashion, and will often be available on one channel but not the other.

If you encounter an error, confirm that you are running `1.6.7-tectonic.2` before reading the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer/blob/master/Documentation/troubleshooting/tectonic-upgrade.md#upgrading-to-171-tectonic1).
